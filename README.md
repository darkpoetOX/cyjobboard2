#Job board website for candidates and employers alike who just can't stand the headaches of conventional application processes. This web app just requires candidates to click on a job they're interested in. The employer gets notified and they just turn up on the date provided in the job description and prove they can do the job by doing whatever task the employer sets. If fine, the candidate gets the job. 
#For people looking to cut the headaches of CVs, silly interview questions and just focuses on ability to do the job.
